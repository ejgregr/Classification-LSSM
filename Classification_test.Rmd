### Cross-correlations
When cross-correlations exceeded 0.6 among the predictors (Table 2, Table 3), one of them was removed. Cross-correlations included: *julSSpd_ave* with *julBSpd_ave*, *julSS_ave* and *julSS_min*, and *julST_ave* and *julST_max*. Current speed at the surface was deemed more important than at the  bottom; minimum salinity more important than average salinity, and maximum SST more important than average. The predictors *julST_ave*, *julSS_ave*, *julBSpd_ave* were therefore dropped. Additionally, after initial explorations of clusters, *northness* was seen to constantly contribute equally across clusters and was thus also dropped. 

This left **8** potential predictors.

```{r Correlations, results='asis', echo=FALSE, table.pos='t' }
# Caption is part of kable()
# Using global: cor_table 

y_low <- lower.tri(cor_table, diag = TRUE)
cor_table[ y_low ] <- NA
knitr::kable( cor_table, digits = 2, format = "latex", booktabs = TRUE, 
              caption = "Correlation matrix for assessing predictor cross-correlations") %>%
  kable_styling( latex_options = c("scale_down") ) %>% 
  row_spec(0, angle = 90) 
#%>% landscape()

x <- 0.6
high_rows <- apply(cor_table, 1, function(row) any(row > x, na.rm = TRUE))
z <- cor_table[ high_rows, ]
knitr::kable( z, digits = 2, format = "latex", booktabs = TRUE, 
              caption = "Predictor variables that exceed 0.6 threshold") %>%
  kable_styling( latex_options = c("scale_down") ) %>% 
  row_spec(0, angle = 90) 
#%>% landscape()

```
